def tournament(rng, population,n):

	Returns the "n" best Individuals in the population.

	Parameters:
	population (list): A list of Individuals, sorted from best to worse.

def getOffspring(rng, population, tournament_size):

	Genetic Operator: Selects a genetic operator and returns a list with the 
	offspring Individuals. The crossover GOs return two Individuals and the
	mutation GO returns one individual. Individuals over the LIMIT_DEPTH are 
	then excluded, making it possible for this method to return an empty list.

	Parameters:
	population (list): A list of Individuals, sorted from best to worse.
